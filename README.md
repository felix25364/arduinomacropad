# Arduino Macropad
This is a small program i wrote (with the help of DeepSeek) wich is for a MacroPad i built
It should work with any Arduino (have only tested with Arduino Nano Every and Nano Clone Board).
This Program works with Linux (Ubuntu 24.04LTS and Arch btw, need to use Pipewire) and MacOS 14 (others may work but not tested).
Have fun using it!
